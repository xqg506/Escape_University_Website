                        <h2>Game Plan</h2>

                <h3>Goal of the game</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start in Langwith, you’ve locked yourself out (no phone) trying to make the bus for your night out, need to go to Ron Cooke Hub to get your card replacement (currently daytime). This will take time to navigate.</li>
                    <li>Side map: enter Ron Cooke Hub, text box, get your keycard, become dark outside, now get given a torch.</li>
                    <li>Exit back to the main map (now dark). Press a button to turn the torch on.</li>
                    <li>While navigating back to Langwith to retrieve a phone, goose steals your torch, catch the goose to get it back. You get bonus points if the goose is caught before stopping to rest.</li>
                    <li>Enter Langwith (side map), get your phone, get food (positive interaction - gain speed boost etc), leave accomodation and make it to the bus station in time for the bus/timer and gain points based on time remaining.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Need a local highscore and leaderboard - should be a name enter for the leaderboard.</li>
                    <li>Need to store this somewhere - external database (?).</li>
                    <li>Should be a menu/pause/options screen along with character selection.</li>
                    <li>Other hindrances: don't get hit by cyclists/bus.</li>
                    <li>Cornered by your supervisor - timer is still going - 20 second cutscene.</li>
                    <li>Have to hold your keycard by keeping left click down - otherwise you drop it.</li>
                    <li>If you go in the lake you are slower, the goose moves faster - goose always ends its run in the lake (2 different paths that the goose can take).</li>
                    <li>Collectable thing that directly increases your score.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>UI</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Score in the top</li>
                    <li>timer - when the timer runs out automatically fails.</li>
                    <li>Pause button + pause screen</li>
                    <li>Fail screen</li>
                    <li>Win screen - display score and leaderboard - score = points+ remaining time (?) - show the points makeup</li>
                    <li>Quit or replay options</li>
                    <li>Mission text</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Additional considerations</h3>
                <p>
                    Child friendly,<br>
                    Different screen sizes<br>
                    Different operating systems, linux, windows, max<br>
                    Consider simple solutions for Colourblindness,<br>
                    Timer, basic counter<br>
                    It needs to be a challenge but not too difficult.<br>
                    2d, top down<br>
                    Clear graphics, consider user group<br>
                    Yes - sound and music, turn sounds on and off
                </p>
